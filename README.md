# Memory-Improvement
A Mobile App that collects information which is personal to the patient. The inputs are given to the app by the patient. If the patient is not capable enough to provide correct inputs, then the information is provided by one of the patient’s guardians.

This app provides:

    Quiz: Q&A to the patient to keep his memory intact. This will in a way remind him of happy times and hence suppressing the negative emotions in him. Our client believes that, even a small piece of happiness to his patients’ is another slim chance that can keep them away from depression.


    Calendar/Diary/Reminders: He wants the patients to add events/occasions or a note in the app which can be used in the quiz or help set reminders for the same. For example, reminding the patient of a family event that makes him happy.


    Personal images / videos: Based on the images selected by the patient, the app will display a slideshow of the images or create a picture puzzle of the image. The client believes that this will remind the patient of happy moments.
